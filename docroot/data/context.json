As chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1993, she wrote and spoke about the importance of teaching children about the leaders, events, and ideas that have shaped our world, and she worked to provide opportunities for teachers to gain the in-depth knowledge that lies behind inspired instruction. Mrs. Cheney has worked to bring tales of the American past to a wide audience, writing articles about history for numerous publications on topics ranging from women's suffrage in the West to the way Americans celebrated the country's centennial. She has also turned her attention to children and their families, writing six bestselling history books for them, the most recent being We the People: The Story of Our Constitution (Simon & Schuster, 2008). She is currently working on an in-depth biography of James Madison.","website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Person","updated_at":"2016-10-26T14:29:51Z","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"aliases":["Lynne Cheney"],"types":["Person","Public Official"],"extensions":{"Person":{"name_last":"Cheney","name_first":"Lynne","name_middle":null,"name_prefix":null,"name_suffix":null,"name_nick":null,"birthplace":null,"gender_id":1,"party_id":null,"is_independent":null,"net_worth":null,"name_maiden":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/40194-Lynne_Cheney"}},{"type":"entities","id":"40150","attributes":{"name":"Bush Cheney 2000","blurb":null,"summary":null,"website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Org","updated_at":"2014-10-29T14:54:10Z","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"aliases":["Bush Cheney 2000","Bush-Cheney 2000 Inc."],"types":["Organization","Political Fundraising Committee"],"extensions":{"Org":{"name":"Bush Cheney 2000","name_nick":null,"employees":null,"revenue":null,"fedspending_id":null,"lda_registrant_id":null},"PoliticalFundraising":{"fec_id":null,"type_id":null,"state_id":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/40150-Bush_Cheney_2000"}},{"type":"entities","id":"194649","attributes":{"name":"Elliott Cheney","blurb":"Emeritus Professor of Math, University Of Texas At Austin","summary":null,"website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Person","updated_at":"2015-04-20T22:31:05Z","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"aliases":["Elliott Cheney"],"types":["Person","Academic"],"extensions":{"Person":{"name_last":"Cheney","name_first":"Elliott","name_middle":null,"name_prefix":null,"name_suffix":null,"name_nick":null,"birthplace":null,"gender_id":null,"party_id":null,"is_independent":null,"net_worth":null,"name_maiden":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/194649-Elliott_Cheney"}},{"type":"entities","id":"134032","attributes":{"name":"William H Cheney","blurb":null,"summary":null,"website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Person","updated_at":"2013-10-07T19:16:06Z","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"aliases":["William H Cheney"],"types":["Person"],"extensions":{"Person":{"name_last":"Cheney","name_first":"William","name_middle":"H","name_prefix":null,"name_suffix":null,"name_nick":null,"birthplace":null,"gender_id":null,"party_id":null,"is_independent":null,"net_worth":null,"name_maiden":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/134032-William_H_Cheney"}},{"type":"entities","id":"136822","attributes":{"name":"Roger Nelson Cheney","blurb":"Owner, Southwest Benefits Corp","summary":null,"website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Person","updated_at":"2013-10-25T19:35:02Z","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"aliases":["Roger Nelson Cheney"],"types":["Person","Business Person"],"extensions":{"Person":{"name_last":"Cheney","name_first":"Roger","name_middle":"Nelson","name_prefix":null,"name_suffix":null,"name_nick":null,"birthplace":null,"gender_id":null,"party_id":null,"is_independent":null,"net_worth":null,"name_maiden":null},"BusinessPerson":{"sec_cik":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/136822-Roger_Nelson_Cheney"}},{"type":"entities","id":"150123","attributes":{"name":"Elizabeth Cheney","blurb":"U.S. President Taft's Great-Great-Grandmother","summary":null,"website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Person","updated_at":"2014-03-31T23:58:22Z","start_date":"1707-00-00","end_date":"1783-00-00","aliases":["Elizabeth Cheney"],"types":["Person"],"extensions":{"Person":{"name_last":"Cheney","name_first":"Elizabeth","name_middle":null,"name_prefix":null,"name_suffix":null,"name_nick":null,"birthplace":null,"gender_id":1,"party_id":null,"is_independent":null,"net_worth":null,"name_maiden":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/150123-Elizabeth_Cheney"}},{"type":"entities","id":"73607","attributes":{"name":"Mary Cheney","blurb":"Daughter of Dick Cheney","summary":null,"website":null,"parent_id":null,"primary_ext":"Person","updated_at":"2014-07-16T11:47:52Z","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"aliases":["Mary Cheney"],"types":["Person"],"extensions":{"Person":{"name_last":"Cheney","name_first":"Mary","name_middle":null,"name_prefix":null,"name_suffix":null,"name_nick":null,"birthplace":null,"gender_id":null,"party_id":null,"is_independent":null,"net_worth":null,"name_maiden":null}}},"links":{"self":"https://littlesis.org/entities/73607-Mary_Cheney"}}]}},"entities":{}}
